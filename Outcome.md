# Course Outcomes

The student will learn

1. To formulate simple algorithms for arithmetic and logical problems.
2. To translate the algorithms to programs (in C language).
3. To test and execute the programs and correct syntax and logical errors.
4. To implement conditional branching, iteration and recursion.
5. To decompose a problem into functions and synthesize a complete program using divide and conquer approach.
6. To use arrays, pointers and structures to formulate algorithms and programs.
7. To apply programming to solve matrix addition and multiplication problems and searching and sorting problems.
8. To apply programming to solve simple numerical method problems, namely root finding of function, differentiation of function and simple integration.


# Laboratory Outcomes

1. To formulate the algorithms for simple problems.
2. To translate given algorithms to a working and correct program.
3. To be able to correct syntax errors as reported by the compilers.
4. To be able to identify and correct logical errors encountered at run time.
5. To be able to write iterative as well as recursive programs.
6. To be able to represent data in arrays, strings and structures and manipulate them through a program.
7. To be able to declare pointers of different types and use them in defining self-referential structures.
8. To be able to create, read and write to and from simple text files.
